"# ExploringLINQ-WithMoreLinq" 

One of my favourite open source libraries is MoreLINQ. It simply extends LINQ with several additional extension methods.

It's basically filling in the missing parts of LINQ, although the chances are, most of the time you'll only need to reach for one or two MoreLINQ extension methods.


***** I will also be attempting to implement my own versions of LINQ Extension methods ************
